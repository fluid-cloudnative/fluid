The following sections will give you step by step instructions on how to get started making code contributions to Fluid.

### Setting up Development Workspace
We assume you've got a Github ID. If then, all you need to do can be summarized to the following steps:

1. **Fork Fluid repository** 

    Click the "Fork" button that can be found at the up-right corner of the [main page of the Fluid repository](https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid). After then you'll get a forked repository which you Github user have full access to.

2. **Clone your own repository** 
    
    Use `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fluid.git` to clone the forked repository to your local machine.

3. **Set remote upstream**
    ```shell
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid.git
    git remote set-url --push upstream no-pushing
    ```

4. **Update local working directory**
    ```shell
    cd fluid
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout master
    git rebase upstream/master
    ```
5. **Create new branch**
    ```shell
    git checkout -b <new-branch>
    ```
    Develop and make any changes on the `<new-branch>`. For more information about developing Fluid, see [developer guide](docs/en/dev/how_to_develop.md)


### Submitting Pull Requests
Once you've done your work on developing Fluid, you are now ready to submit a PR to the Fluid project.

First of all, push your commits to your forked repository on Github

```shell
git push origin <new-branch>
```

Go to the "Pull requests" tab page under your repository and Click the "New Pull Request" button to submit a PR. Select `<new-branch>`, check your commits, fill in PR title and description and finally click the "Create pull request" button to finish submitting.

To help reviewers better get your purpose, PR title should be descriptive enough but not too long. It's also recommended that you follow the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) as your PR description.

### Tracking Your PR
Once you've submitted the PR to the Fluid project, your PR will be reviewed. Please keep tracking the status of your PR, make responses to the reviewers' comments and update your changes if needed to make your PR get accepted.

After at least one approval from reviewers, your PR will soon be merged into Fluid code base. Cheer! You've now contributed to the Fluid project. Thank you for your contribution and you are always welcome!
