# Demo - Set Dataset Access Mode

## Prerequisites
Before everything we are going to do, please refer to [Installation Guide](../userguide/install.md) to install Fluid on your Kubernetes Cluster, and make sure all the components used by Fluid are ready like this:
```shell
$ kubectl get pod -n fluid-system
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
alluxioruntime-controller-5b64fdbbb-84pc6   1/1     Running   0          8h
csi-nodeplugin-fluid-fwgjh                  2/2     Running   0          8h
csi-nodeplugin-fluid-ll8bq                  2/2     Running   0          8h
dataset-controller-5b7848dbbb-n44dj         1/1     Running   0          8h
```

Normally, you shall see a Pod named "dataset-controller", a Pod named "alluxioruntime-controller" and several Pods named "csi-nodeplugin". 
The num of "csi-nodeplugin" Pods depends on how many nodes your Kubernetes cluster have(e.g. 2 in this demo), so please make sure all "csi-nodeplugin" Pods are working properly.

## Set dataset access mode
The access mode of the dataset is set to **ReadOnlyMany** when user doesn`t specif the access mode. If there is a need to modify the default access mode, you need to specify it in spec.accessModes[] before creating it.

The currently supported access modes areï¼š
- `ReadOnlyMany` : the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes
- `ReadWriteMany` : the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes


## Demo
This demo sets the access method of the dataset to ReadWriteMany.
```
