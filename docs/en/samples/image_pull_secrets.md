# image pull secrets


If the images of fluid runtime is in private docker registry, it's necessary to set image pull secret.
For related knowledge of image pull secret,     
please refer to [Pull an Image from a Private Registry
](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)

fluid supports setting image pull secrets when you deploy fluid service using helm charts

you can set the image pull secrets to `values.yaml` like the following example
```yaml
# fluid helm charts values.yaml 
# default imagePullSecrets value is empty
image:
  imagePullSecrets: []

# set values like this 
# suppose you have two image pull secret keys `test-1` and `test-2` in your cluster
image:
  imagePullSecrets: 
  - name: test-1
  - name: test-2
```

After setting `values.yaml` image pull secrets, when you have deployed the fluid service,  
you can see that controller itself already uses image pull secrets



alluxio controller yaml intercepts information
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: alluxioruntime-controller
  namespace: fluid-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: fluidcloudnative/alluxioruntime-controller:
        name: manager
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: test-1
      - name: test-2
```

fluid also supports passing the image pull secrets through the controller to the runtime service that the controller pulls up

alluxio runtime master yaml intercepts information
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: demo-master
  namespace: test
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: fluidcloudnative/alluxio:release-2.8.1-SNAPSHOT-0433ade
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: alluxio-master
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: test1
      - name: test2

```
In conclusion, image pull secrets setting successfully
