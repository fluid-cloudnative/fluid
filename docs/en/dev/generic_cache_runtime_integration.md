# Integration

## Step 1. Plan Cluster Topology

First, you need to plan a cluster topology:

*   Determine the topology type and which components are included:


*   MasterSlave: Master/Worker/Client

*   P2P/DHT: Worker/Client

*   ClientOnly: Client


*   Determine the form and configuration of each component:


*   Stateful/Stateless - Determines the workload type

*   Standalone/Active-Standby/Cluster


The table below shows basic information examples for deploying several major cache topology types.

*   MasterSlave: CubeFS/Alluxio


| Topology |  | Settings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | --- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Master |  | *   workLoadType: apps/v1/StatefulSet<br>    <br>*   Image configuration<br>   <br>*   Startup command<br>  <br>*   UFS mount command<br>   <br>*   HeadlessService needs to be created<br>    <br>*   Authentication keys need to be mounted                             |
| Worker: Used for single worker role definition |  | *   workLoadType: apps/v1/StatefulSet<br>    <br>*   Image configuration<br>    <br>*   Startup command<br>    <br>*   HeadlessService needs to be created<br>    <br>*   Authentication keys do NOT need to be mounted<br>    <br>*   TieredStore needs to be configured |
| Client | Fuse | *   Role: Posix client<br>    <br>*   workLoadType: apps/v1/DaemonSet<br>    <br>*   Image configuration<br>    <br>*   Startup command<br>    <br>*   Authentication parameters do NOT need to be mounted<br>    <br>*   TieredStore is NOT supported                    |

*   P2P Worker: JuiceFS


| Topology | Settings |
| --- | --- |
| Worker: Used for single worker role definition | *   workLoadType: apps/v1/StatefulSet<br>    <br>*   Image configuration<br>    <br>*   Startup command<br>    <br>*   HeadlessService<br>    <br>*   Authentication parameters need to be mounted<br>    <br>*   TieredStore is supported |
| Client | *   Role: Fuse client<br>    <br>*   workLoadType: apps/v1/DaemonSet<br>    <br>*   Image configuration<br>    <br>*   Startup command<br>    <br>*   Service is NOT required<br>    <br>*   Authentication parameters need to be mounted<br>    <br>*   TieredStore is supported |

## Step 2. Prepare Cache System Template

A cache system template in Fluid contains the following parts:

```yaml
├── Name # runtimeClassName is specified in CacheRuntime
├── FileSystemType # File system type, used for mount readiness verification
├── Topology
│   ├── Master[component]
│   ├── Worker[component]
│   └── client[component]
└── ExtraResources
    └── ConfigMaps
```

The component in Topology mainly contains the following content:

| Content | Description                 | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --- |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WorkloadType | The workload type of this component           | For stateful applications like Master/Worker, StatefulSet is the most common choice, as it can more easily cooperate with formatted DNS domain names provided by Headless Service for access<br>If Client is a Fuse client responsible for providing Posix access capability for pods on nodes, DaemonSet is generally used<br>If Client is an SDK proxy as a centralized stateless application, Deployment with ClusterIP type Service is generally used |
| Options | Default options, will be overridden by user settings |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Template | PodTemplateSpec native field   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Service | Currently only supports Headless      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Dependencies | ExtraResources     | Whether this component needs to mount additional ConfigMaps (the dependent ConfigMap information is defined in the ExtraResources field of CacheRuntimeClass).                                                                                                                                     |
| ExecutionEntries| MountUFS           | For Master-Worker architecture, when Master is Ready, the underlying file system mount operation needs to be executed. The MountUFS script must output JSON in `CacheRuntimeMountUfsOutput` struct format, containing the list of mounted UFS paths. See Step 2.7 for details.                                                                                                                                      |
| ExecutionEntries| ReportSummary      | Defines operations for the cache system to obtain cache information metrics, the command must output JSON in `CacheRuntimeReportSummary` struct format.                                                                                                                                                   |

### Step 2.1 Prepare K8s-adapted Native Images and Define Component workloadType and PodTemplate

You can first use native images, configure component **workloadType** and **PodTemplate**, manually start a fixed cache system in the K8s cluster, manually start the cache system in the pod, and make it locally accessible. This step is mainly used to clarify what K8s resources are needed and to prepare base images.

### Step 2.2 Clarify What Configurations CacheRuntime Should Provide for Components

Mainly clarify the following settings:

*   Service

*   Dependencies


### Step 2.3 Confirm Default ENV Provided by Fluid CacheRuntime for Components, Applicable by Scripts Inside Containers

| ENV | Description                               |
| --- |----------------------------------|
| FLUID_DATASET_NAME | Dataset name, generally used for isolation between groups in cache group concepts  |
| FLUID_DATASET_NAMESPACE | Namespace where the dataset is located               |
| FLUID_RUNTIME_CONFIG_PATH | Runtime configuration path provided by fluid             |
| FLUID_RUNTIME_MOUNT_PATH | Often used by Client, the target path where client performs mount action |
| FLUID_RUNTIME_COMPONENT_TYPE | Indicates whether the current component is master, worker, or client    |
| FLUID_RUNTIME_COMPONENT_SVC_NAME | If the component defines a service, this value is the service name    |

### Step 2.4 Create RuntimeClass Example and Field Description:

```yaml
apiVersion: data.fluid.io/v1alpha1
kind: CacheRuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: demofs
fileSystemType: $fsType
topology:
  master:
    service: # Need to create Headless Service for master
      headless: {}
    executionEntries:
      mountUFS: # mount ufs in master pod, see section 2.7 
        command:
          - bash
          - -c
          - /mountUfs.sh
        timeout: 120
      reportSummary: # get cache states in master pod, see section 2.8 
        command:
          - bash
          - -c
          - /reportSummary.sh
        timeout: 30
    template:
      spec:
        restartPolicy: Always
        containers:
        - name: master
          image: $image
          args:
          - /bin/sh
          - -c
          - custom-endpoint.sh
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  worker:
    service: # create Headless Service for worker
      headless: {} 
    template:
      spec:
        restartPolicy: Always
        containers:
        - name: worker
          image: $image
          args:
          - /bin/sh
          - -c
          - custom-endpoint.sh
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  client:
    template:
      spec:
        restartPolicy: Always
        containers:
        - name: client
          image: $image 
          securityContext: # Usually client needs to configure privileged for operating fuse device
            privileged: true
            runAsUser: 0
          args:
          - /bin/sh
          - -c
          - custom-endpoint.sh
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

#### Cache Systems Without a Client Component

The master, worker and client components under `topology` are all optional in the API. You may omit the **client** component if the underlying cache system has both of the following characteristics:

1. **No POSIX mount semantics**: the cache system itself provides no FUSE-like mount capability.
2. **Applications connect directly**: applications read and write against the master/worker through the cache system's own SDK or RPC client, without relying on a mount point.

In that case the Master and Worker components start as usual, the Dataset reaches the Bound phase as usual, and cache status is still reported through the ReportSummary script.

Note that Fluid still creates a PVC/PV for such a Dataset and reports them as Bound, but an application pod that mounts the PVC stays in ContainerCreating forever (reporting `timeout waiting for FUSE mount point`). Application pods of these cache systems should not mount that PVC; the application should talk to the cache service directly.

To do that, the application needs things like the master's address. Add the following label and annotation to the application pod, and Fluid's webhook injects the runtime config when the pod is created:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    fluid.io/inject: "true"
  annotations:
    fluid.io/datasets: "demofs"    # comma-separated for several datasets
```

For each dataset in the annotation, the pod gets:

- a volume `fluid-runtime-config-<dataset>`, backed by that dataset's runtime config ConfigMap;
- mounted read-only at `/etc/fluid/config/<dataset>/`;
- an env var `FLUID_RUNTIME_CONFIG_PATH_<DATASET>` pointing at `runtime.sh` in that directory.

The dataset name in the env var is upper-cased and `-` becomes `_`, since shell variable names can't contain `-`. Dataset `mooncake-demo`, for example, gives `FLUID_RUNTIME_CONFIG_PATH_MOONCAKE_DEMO`.

The application container then sources the file from its entrypoint:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
. "$FLUID_RUNTIME_CONFIG_PATH_DEMOFS"

# Build the address yourself; ports aren't in the runtime config and are up to the integrator.
MASTER_HOST="${MASTER_NAME}-0.${MASTER_SERVICE_NAME}"
export MY_APP_MASTER_ADDR="${MASTER_HOST}:50051"

exec "$@"
```

The variables in `runtime.sh` are described in "Shell Form of RuntimeConfig" below.

Some things to keep in mind:

- The datasets in the annotation have to be in the same namespace as the application pod. A ConfigMap volume can't cross namespaces, so the annotation only carries dataset names.
- Injection happens once, when the pod is created; fields like `volumes` can't change afterwards. If a dataset in the annotation doesn't exist or isn't Bound yet, pod creation is rejected with an error naming the dataset. Controllers such as Deployments and Jobs keep retrying, so the pod gets created once the dataset is Bound.
- If the dataset's runtime config has no `runtime.sh` (with an older cacheruntime-controller, for example), the pod is created but nothing is injected; the reason only shows up in the webhook's log.
- If the runtime changes later (say, the master is scaled), the ConfigMap is updated and kubelet syncs the file in the container, but the application only sources it once at startup and won't read it again.
- Sourcing only works for one dataset at a time. Variable names in `runtime.sh` have no dataset prefix, so sourcing two files in a row makes the second overwrite the first. To use several datasets, read `runtime.json` in the same directory instead, or copy the variables you need to other names after each `source`.

For a complete configuration example, see [Deploy Mooncake with CacheRuntime](../samples/cacheruntime/mooncake_cache_runtime.md).

### Step 2.5 User Creates Runtime

```yaml
apiVersion: data.fluid.io/v1alpha1
kind: Dataset
metadata:
  name: demofs
  namespace: default
spec:
  placement: Shared
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  mounts:
  - name: demo
    mountPoint: "demofs:///"
    options:
      key1: value1
      key2: value2
    encryptOptions:
    - name: token
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: jfs-secret
          key: token
    - name: access-key
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: jfs-secret
          key: access-key
    - name: secret-key
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: jfs-secret
          key: secret-key
---
apiVersion: data.fluid.io/v1alpha1
kind: CacheRuntime
metadata:
  name: demofs
  namespace: default
spec:
  runtimeClassName: demofs
  master:
    options: # master option
      key1: value1
      key2: value2
    replicas: 2 # master replica count
  worker:
    options: # worker option
      key1: value1
      key2: value2
    replicas: 2 # worker
    tieredStore:
      levels: # worker cache configuration
      - emptyDir:
          quota: 1Gi
        high: "0.8"
        low: "0.5"
  client:
    options:
      key1: value1
      key2: value2
    volumeMounts: # Can configure volumes and corresponding volumeMounts
    - name: demo
      mountPath: /mnt
  volumes:
  - name: demo
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: test

```

For detailed configuration instructions on tiered storage, please refer to [CacheRuntime TieredStore Configuration Example](../userguide/cache_runtime_tieredstore.md).

### Step 2.6 Confirm RuntimeConfig Provided by Fluid CacheRuntime for Components, Parse Parameters to Start Containers
> You can modify the entryPoint script based on the native image, first parse RuntimeConfig, generate corresponding configuration files, and then start the container.
> You can refer to the integration example in test/gha-e2e/curvine in the official repository.

In cacheruntime, all control plane processes are handled by Fluid. However, as a data caching engine, when providing services, the entire cache system requires **topology**, **data source**, **authentication**, and **cache information**. Fluid will provide this information to components through configuration files based on different Component roles. The component's internal process is responsible for parsing this configuration to perform environment variable configuration, data engine configuration file generation, and other operations. After preparation is complete, the data engine process can be started. For specific parsing details, please refer to the table below:

*   Taking the above resources as an example, the Config examples mounted by Master/Worker/Client and maintained by Fluid are as follows:
the `mounts`, `accessModes`, and `targetPath` fields in the JSON are all derived from the Dataset's Spec definition.

```json
{
  "mounts": [
    {
      "mountPoint": "s3://test",
      "options": {
        "access": "minioadmin",
        "endpoint_url": "http://minio:9000",
        "path_style": "true",
        "region_name": "us-east-1",
        "secret": "minioadmin"
      },
      "encryptOptions": {
        "access-key": "/etc/fluid/secrets/minio-secret/access-key",
        "secret-key": "/etc/fluid/secrets/minio-secret/secret-key"
      },
      "name": "minio",
      "path": "/minio"
    }
  ],
  "accessModes": [
    "ReadWriteMany"
  ],
  "targetPath": "/runtime-mnt/cache/default/curvine-demo/cache-fuse",
  "master": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "curvine-demo-master",
    "options": {
      "key1": "master-value1"
    },
    "replicas": 1,
    "service": {
      "name": "svc-curvine-demo-master"
    }
  },
  "worker": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "curvine-demo-worker",
    "options": {
      "key1": "worker-value1"
    },
    "replicas": 1,
    "service": {
      "name": "svc-curvine-demo-worker"
    },
    "tieredStoreLevels": [
      {
        "mountPaths": [
          "/etc/fluid/mount/tiered-store/level-0-index-0-emptydir"
        ],
        "mediumType": "HDD",
        "quotas": [
          "1Gi"
        ],
        "high": "0.8",
        "low": "0.5"
      }
    ]
  },
  "client": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "curvine-demo-client",
    "options": {
      "key1": "value1"
    },
    "service": {
      "name": ""
    }
  }
}
```

#### Shell Form of RuntimeConfig

Next to `runtime.json`, the same ConfigMap holds a `runtime.sh` with the same content written as shell `export` statements, so an image without a JSON parser can simply `source` it. The `runtime.json` above comes out as:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Generated by Fluid. DO NOT EDIT.
export RUNTIME_TARGETPATH='/runtime-mnt/cache/default/curvine-demo/cache-fuse'
export RUNTIME_ACCESSMODES_COUNT='1'
export RUNTIME_ACCESSMODE_0='ReadWriteMany'
export MOUNTS_COUNT='1'
export MOUNT_0_NAME='minio'
export MOUNT_0_PATH='/minio'
export MOUNT_0_MOUNTPOINT='s3://test'
export MOUNT_0_READONLY='false'
export MOUNT_0_SHARED='false'
export MOUNT_0_OPTIONS='{"access":"minioadmin","endpoint_url":"http://minio:9000","path_style":"true","region_name":"us-east-1","secret":"minioadmin"}'
export MOUNT_0_ENCRYPTOPTIONS='{"access-key":"/etc/fluid/secrets/minio-secret/access-key","secret-key":"/etc/fluid/secrets/minio-secret/secret-key"}'
export MASTER_ENABLED='true'
export MASTER_NAME='curvine-demo-master'
export MASTER_REPLICAS='1'
export MASTER_SERVICE_NAME='svc-curvine-demo-master'
export MASTER_OPTIONS='{"key1":"master-value1"}'
export MASTER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVELS_COUNT='0'
export WORKER_ENABLED='true'
export WORKER_NAME='curvine-demo-worker'
export WORKER_REPLICAS='1'
export WORKER_SERVICE_NAME='svc-curvine-demo-worker'
export WORKER_OPTIONS='{"key1":"worker-value1"}'
export WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVELS_COUNT='1'
export WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVEL_0_MEDIUMTYPE='HDD'
export WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVEL_0_MOUNTPATHS_COUNT='1'
export WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVEL_0_MOUNTPATH_0='/etc/fluid/mount/tiered-store/level-0-index-0-emptydir'
export WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVEL_0_QUOTAS_COUNT='1'
export WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVEL_0_QUOTA_0='1Gi'
export WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVEL_0_HIGH='0.8'
export WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVEL_0_LOW='0.5'
export CLIENT_ENABLED='true'
export CLIENT_NAME='curvine-demo-client'
export CLIENT_REPLICAS='0'
export CLIENT_SERVICE_NAME=''
export CLIENT_OPTIONS='{"key1":"value1"}'
export CLIENT_TIEREDSTORE_LEVELS_COUNT='0'
```

Shell has no nested values, so everything is flattened:

- A plain field is `PREFIX_FIELD`, e.g. `MASTER_NAME`, `MASTER_SERVICE_NAME`.
- A list gets a count, then one numbered variable per element: `MOUNTS_COUNT` and `MOUNT_0_NAME`, `RUNTIME_ACCESSMODES_COUNT` and `RUNTIME_ACCESSMODE_0`, and for tiered storage `WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVELS_COUNT` and names like `WORKER_TIEREDSTORE_LEVEL_0_QUOTA_0`.
- A map (the various `OPTIONS`) becomes a JSON string; parse it yourself if you need it, or read `runtime.json` instead.

A component the topology leaves out still gets the same set of variables, with `ENABLED` set to `false` and the rest empty. Check `ENABLED` to tell whether a component is there; a script running with `set -u` won't trip over a missing variable. Without a client, the client lines are:

```sh
export CLIENT_ENABLED='false'
export CLIENT_NAME=''
export CLIENT_REPLICAS='0'
export CLIENT_SERVICE_NAME=''
export CLIENT_OPTIONS='{}'
export CLIENT_TIEREDSTORE_LEVELS_COUNT='0'
```

Values are single-quoted. Things like `mountPoint` and `options` come from user input, and inside double quotes the shell would expand `$` and backticks. A single quote inside a value is written as `'\''`.

In a component pod, `$FLUID_RUNTIME_CONFIG_PATH` points at `runtime.json`, and `runtime.sh` sits in the same directory.

### Step 2.7 MountUFS Script Output Format Requirements

For cache systems with Master-Worker architecture, after the Master component is Ready, Fluid will execute the MountUFS script to mount the underlying file system (UFS). **The MountUFS script must output JSON in `CacheRuntimeMountUfsOutput` struct format**, so that Fluid can correctly parse the mounted paths and synchronize the Dataset status.

#### Optional Configuration Note

If the underlying cache system's image has the following capabilities, you can **omit the MountUFS configuration**:

1. **Automatic RuntimeConfig Monitoring**: The process inside the container can monitor changes to the "$FLUID_RUNTIME_CONFIG_PATH" file
2. **Automatic Mount Execution**: When changes to the mounts configuration are detected, automatically execute the underlying file system mount operations
3. **Ready State Control**: Ensure that the Master component's Pod starting status only becomes Ready after all UFS mounts are completed

In this case, Fluid will confirm whether the Master component is ready through Kubernetes' Ready probe, without needing to execute the MountUFS script additionally.

#### Use Cases

The output of the MountUFS script is mainly used for the following scenarios:

1. **Mount Status Synchronization**: Fluid parses the script output to confirm which UFS paths have been successfully mounted
2. **Dataset Status Update**: Updates the Dataset's mount status and Phase based on the mount results
3. **Dynamic Mount Management**: When the Dataset's mounts configuration changes, Fluid re-executes the MountUFS script and verifies whether the mount operation completed successfully through the output
4. **Remount Detection**: In scenarios such as Master Pod restarts, Fluid determines whether remounting is necessary based on the output

#### Output Format Specification

The standard output of the MountUFS script must be in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "mounted": ["/path1", "/path2", "/path3"]
}
```

Where:
- `mounted`: A string array containing the list of all successfully mounted UFS paths
- If no paths are mounted, output: `{"mounted": []}`

#### Go Struct Definition

```go
type CacheRuntimeMountUfsOutput struct {
    // Mounted are the ufs paths that have been mounted.
    Mounted []string `json:"mounted,omitempty"`
}
```

#### Important Notes

1. **Must output to standard output (stdout)**: Fluid reads JSON data from the script's standard output
2. **Error messages to standard error (stderr)**: Use `>&2` to output error messages to stderr to avoid polluting stdout
3. **JSON format must strictly comply with requirements**: Otherwise, Fluid cannot parse it, leading to mount failure


### Step 2.8 ReportSummary Script Output Format Requirements

The ReportSummary script is used to obtain runtime metrics of the cache system. It executes commands within the component's Pod, and the results are updated to the DataSet's Status field.
**The ReportSummary script must output JSON in `CacheRuntimeReportSummary` struct format**, so that Fluid can correctly parse cache system metrics.

#### Output Format Specification

The standard output of the ReportSummary script must be in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "cached": "0.00B",
  "cachedPercentage": "0",
  "cacheCapacity": "4.00GiB",
  "cacheHitRatio": "0",
  "fileNum": "400",
  "ufsTotal": "100GB"
}
```

Where:
- cached: the amount of data cached, in bytes
- cachedPercentage: percentage of cached data relative to cache capacity, 0-100
- cacheCapacity: total cache data capacity (in bytes)
- cacheHitRatio: cache hit ratio, 0-100
- fileNum: number of files in the Dataset
- ufsTotal: total size of the Dataset (in GB)

#### Important Notes

1. **Must output to standard output (stdout)**: Fluid reads JSON data from the script's standard output
2. **Error messages to standard error (stderr)**: Use `>&2` to output error messages to stderr to avoid polluting stdout
3. **JSON format must strictly comply with requirements**: Otherwise, Fluid cannot parse it
4. If the execution time of `command` is long, such as for the statistics of `fileNum` and `ufsTotal`, the script on the caching side **should not obtain this information in real time**
