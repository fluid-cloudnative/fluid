## What is Fluid?
Fluid is an open source Kubernetes-native Distributed Dataset Orchestrator and Accelerator for data-intensive applications, such as big data and AI applications. It is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as a sandbox project.

For more information, please refer to our paper: Rong Gu, et al. [Fluid: Dataset Abstraction and Elastic Acceleration for Cloud-native Deep Learning Training Jobs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9835158). IEEE ICDE. pp. 2183-2196, May. 2022.

## Features

- __Dataset Abstraction__

  	Implements the unified abstraction for datasets from multiple storage sources, with observability features to help users evaluate the need for scaling the cache system.

- __Scalable Cache Runtime__

  	Offers a unified access interface for data operations with different runtimes, enabling access to third-party storage systems.

- __Automated Data Operations__

  	Provides various automated data operation modes to facilitate integration with automated operations systems.

- __Elasticity and Scheduling__

  	Enhances data access performance by combining data caching technology with elastic scaling, portability, observability, and data affinity-scheduling capabilities.

- __Runtime Platform Agnostic__

  	Supports a variety of environments and can run different storage clients based on the environment, including native, edge, Serverless Kubernetes clusters, and Kubernetes multi-cluster environments.

## Key Concepts

**Dataset**: A Dataset is a set of data logically related that can be used by computing engines, such as Spark for big data analytics and TensorFlow for AI applications. Intelligently leveraging data often creates core industry values. Managing Datasets may require features in different dimensions, such as security, version management and data acceleration. We hope to start with data acceleration to support the management of datasets. 

**Runtime**: The Runtime enforces dataset isolation/share, provides version management, and enables data acceleration by defining a set of interfaces to handle DataSets throughout their lifecycle, allowing for the implementation of management and acceleration functionalities behind these interfaces.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes version > 1.16, and support CSI
- Golang 1.18+
- Helm 3

## Quick Start

You can follow our [Get Started](docs/en/userguide/get_started.md) guide to quickly start a testing Kubernetes cluster.

## Documentation

You can see our documentation at [docs](docs/README.md) for more in-depth installation and instructions for production:

- [English](docs/en/TOC.md)
- [简体中文](docs/zh/TOC.md)

You can also visit [Fluid Homepage](https://fluid-cloudnative.github.io) to get relevant documents.
