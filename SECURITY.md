## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strive to ship secure software, but we need the community to help us find security breaches. In case of a confirmed breach, reporters will get full credit and can be keep in the loop, if preferred.

If you find a security related bug in Fluid, we kindly ask you for responsible disclosure and for giving us appropriate time to react, analyze and develop a fix to mitigate the found security vulnerability.

### Private Disclosure Processes

We ask that all suspected vulnerabilities be privately and responsibly disclosed by contacting our [security contact](SECURITY_CONTACTS.md) or [contacting our maintainers](mailto:fluid.opensource.project@gmail.com).

### Public Disclosure Processes

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability please IMMEDIATELY email the our [security contact](SECURITY_CONTACTS.md) or [contacting our maintainers](mailto:fluid.opensource.project@gmail.com) to inform about the vulnerability so they may start the patch, release, and communication process.

### Compensation

We do not provide compensations for reporting vulnerabilities except for eternal gratitude.

## Communication

[GitHub Security Advisor](https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/security/advisories) will be used to communicate during the process of identifying, fixing & shipping the mitigation of the vulnerability.

The advisory will only be made public when the patched version is released to inform the community of the breach and its potential security impact.
